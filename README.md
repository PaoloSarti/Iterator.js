# Stream.js

A Stream is an iterable object that provides some functional operators to initiate or manipulate its elements.

The implementation is based on new features of the language such as generators.
In fact, it was developed mostly because I wanted to test the new features.

For a reliable implementation of the Stream concept, please see http://winterbe.github.io/streamjs/
