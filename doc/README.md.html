<p>An Iterator is a wrapper to JavaScript's iterators that adds functional operators to it (such as map, reduce...).</p>
<p>Most of its methods return a new Iterator, but they don't execute any operation until explicitly requested.
This is because the functions are executed lazily.
E.g. by iterating with a for..of, or by calling toArray or other methods that consume the Iterator.</p>
<p>Thanks to the laziness of the execution (achieved through generators), infinite Iterators can be manipulated.</p>
<p>The implementation is based on new features of the language such as generators.
In fact, it was developed mostly because I wanted to test the new features.</p>
<p>For a more feature-rich, tested and reliable implementation of this concept, please see http://winterbe.github.io/streamjs/</p>
